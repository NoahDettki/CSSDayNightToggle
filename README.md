# CSSDayNightToggle
A plain html/css toggle switch with day/night theme

I saw [this video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/U32ne0wpgC0) on YouTube shorts and found it very funny, so I tried to make the toggle switch myself. Took me about 1 day because I don't know a lot of CSS and didn't use any of the code shown in the video (if that even is the real code). Feel free to use it.
